Automated Nutrition Plan Generator Final Report

 
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Objective
SmartIntake is a web-based automation platform that streamlines client intake and plan generation for small businesses. The tool collects client information through digital intake forms, applies pre-programmed business rules or formulas (e.g., nutritional guidelines, service plans, or lesson outlines), and automatically generates a draft plan for review.

While initially designed for fitness and nutrition professionals, SmartIntake’s framework can be adapted to other industries such as education, beauty, or home services where intake forms and personalized service plans are required.

Background
This system was conceptualized after interviewing Peak Fitness, a gym in Kerrville, TX. The owner expressed the need for a solution to reduce manual intake and nutrition planning time, which currently takes up to 2.5 hours per client. The proposed solution will significantly reduce this time, allowing small business owners to focus on revenue-generating activities.

Methodology
•	Discovery & Requirements: The project began with a structured stakeholder interview conducted with the owner of Peak Fitness in Kerrville, Texas. The purpose of this phase was to identify operational pain points, inefficiencies, and constraints in the current client intake and nutrition planning process. Through this interview, the team documented:
o	The existing manual intake workflow
o	The time required to build personalized nutrition plans (1–2.5 hours per client)
o	Data accuracy concerns related to inconsistent food databases
o	Key functional requirements, including dietary restrictions, macro targets, and coach approval workflows
o	Non-functional requirements such as affordability, data security, and ease of use
•	System Design & Data Modeling: The system was structured to separate concerns across intake collection, data normalization, business logic execution, and output delivery. A critical component of this phase was the design of a custom food database. Existing nutrition data sources were found to be inconsistent, incomplete, or incompatible with automation needs. To address this, the project lead manually curated and standardized a food bank containing hundreds of entries. Each entry was normalized to a consistent serving size, unit of measurement, macro and micronutrient structure, dietary tags, and meal category classification.
•	Automation Workflow Implementation: Automation logic was implemented using n8n, an open-source workflow automation platform. This phase focused on translating nutritional rules, formulas, and constraints into deterministic workflows rather than opaque AI models. Key automation components included:
o	Intake form parsing and validation
o	Calorie and macronutrient calculations
o	Rule-based food filtering (dietary restrictions, preferences, exclusions)
o	Meal distribution logic across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks
o	Error handling for missing or restrictive data scenarios
•	User Interface Integration: Parallel to backend automation, the team developed user-facing interfaces that allowed coaches to interact with the system efficiently. This included:
o	A digital intake form for client data submission
o	A trainer-facing review workflow to approve or adjust generated plans
o	A structured output format for client delivery
•	Testing, Validation, & Integration: Testing was conducted iteratively throughout development, with emphasis on functional accuracy rather than synthetic benchmarks. Generated nutrition plans were compared against manually created plans to validate macro distribution, dietary compliance, and overall feasibility. Special attention was given to:
o	Data consistency across food entries
o	Correct application of exclusion rules
o	Stability under varying intake profiles
o	Workflow resilience when encountering null or missing values

Key Findings
•	Manual intake and nutrition planning consume significant time. The process currently takes 1–2.5 hours per client, limiting the number of clients the trainer can serve daily.
•	Automating repetitive tasks can directly increase revenue. By offloading data entry and formula calculations to an automated system, the trainer can focus on higher-value services, potentially earning thousands more weekly.
•	Data accuracy and reliability are critical to adoption. The client emphasized that automation must be trustworthy and align closely with human judgment; if accuracy is compromised, the system will not be used.
•	Security and cost are the main barriers. Peak Fitness needs a solution that stores data securely and remains affordable. We are targeting under $200 per year instead of the quoted $150,000 per year from commercial AI systems.
•	Scalability potential is high. The same framework can be adapted for other service-based industries such as education, wellness, and personal care. Any business that relies on client intake and personalized service generation.







Recommendations
•	Expand and maintain the custom food database to include additional foods, brands, and specialty diets.
•	Integrate barcode scanning to automate nutrition data entry and reduce manual database updates.
•	Develop automated goal recalculation to regenerate meal plans as client metrics change.
•	Build a client-facing mobile application for nutrition access, progress tracking, and communication.
•	Introduce AI-assisted features to support client interaction and reduce coach administrative workload while preserving rule-based accuracy.

Conclusion

Milestone 1: Discovery & Requirements
Discovery
The project began with broad discovery across the fitness and nutrition industry. Interviews and informal discussions were conducted with approximately 28 fitness-related businesses to identify common operational challenges. While several pain points emerged, nutrition planning consistently stood out as one of the most time-consuming and inefficient processes. Based on alignment, accessibility, and real-world applicability, the team decided to focus specifically on Peak Fitness as the primary stakeholder for this project.

 

Pain Points
Through stakeholder interviews, several key pain points were identified. Coaches were spending excessive time manually building meal plans, often relying on spreadsheets and inconsistent nutrition data sources. Scaling client load created bottlenecks, reduced plan quality, and increased burnout. Additionally, existing nutrition software solutions were either too limited in functionality or prohibitively expensive for small businesses.


Requirements
To address these pain points, the system needed to automate meal plan generation while maintaining accuracy, affordability, and coach oversight. Core requirements included consistent nutrition data, support for dietary restrictions and preferences, scalable automation, and the ability for coaches to review and approve plans before delivery. These requirements guided all subsequent design and development decisions.


Milestone 2: N8N Infrastructure & Data Model
System Architecture
During this phase, the overall system architecture was designed. The team selected n8n as the automation platform due to its flexibility, transparency, and suitability for rule-based logic. Data flow was structured to separate intake processing, calculation logic, food selection, and output delivery, ensuring maintainability and scalability.

Flow A: Nutrition Plan Generator
 

Flow B: Manual Food Uploader (custom food bank)
 

Custom Food Database
A major focus of this milestone was the creation of a custom food database. Existing nutrition databases were found to be inconsistent and unreliable for automation. Hundreds of food entries were manually curated, normalized to a standard serving size, and tagged with macro values, micronutrients, dietary indicators, food categories, and meal classifications. This ensured deterministic and accurate automation results.

Data Normalization
All nutrition data was standardized to consistent units and formats to eliminate discrepancies between sources. This normalization step was critical to ensuring that calculations, comparisons, and filtering logic behaved predictably within automated workflows.

Milestone 3: Intake Workflow & Rules Engine
Intake Workflow
A structured digital intake workflow was developed to collect client information, including goals, dietary preferences, restrictions, and health considerations. Validation logic ensured that required fields were present before automation execution began.

Rules Engine
Nutrition logic was translated into a rule-based engine capable of calculating calorie and macronutrient targets. Food selection rules were applied to filter items based on dietary constraints, preferences, and macro compatibility. The rules engine ensured consistent behavior across all client profiles.

Error Handling & Edge Cases
Conditional logic and fallback paths were implemented to handle restrictive diets, missing data, or conflicting inputs. This prevented system failures and ensured reliable plan generation under a wide range of scenarios.





















Milestone 4: Trainer Dashboard & Delivery
Trainer Review Workflow
A coach-facing review step was implemented to allow trainers to inspect and adjust generated meal plans before delivery. This preserved professional oversight while still benefiting from automation efficiency.


 




















User Interface Requirements
Functional UI requirements were defined to ensure the system aligned with real coaching workflows. Interfaces were designed to be intuitive, modern, and efficient, minimizing friction for trainers.


 



















Plan Delivery
Finalized meal plans were structured for clear presentation and easy delivery to clients. This milestone ensured that automation outputs were not only accurate but also usable in a real business setting.

 





Milestone 5: Security, Testing & Final Demo
Testing & Validation
Automated workflows were tested across multiple client scenarios to validate calculation accuracy, rule enforcement, and system stability. Outputs were compared against manually created plans to confirm correctness.

Security & Reliability
Basic security considerations were addressed, including controlled data access and structured data handling. Workflow resilience was improved through defensive logic and validation checks.
